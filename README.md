# BERTopic-internship
This code includes the code for the graduation internship at GroupM Conversational. Period February 2023 - July 2023.


## Problem Description

The manual labelling process of user queries is a challenging task for the Conversational team. The data available is unlabelled, 
which means that the AI trainer must manually label each query by hand. This is a time-consuming and tedious process and poses a 
challenge for the AI trainer. By failing to utilize the available user data efficiently, the team is missing a crucial opportunity 
to improve the accuracy and reliability of their chatbot services. Thus, there is a need for an automated labelling solution that 
surpasses the efficiency of manual labelling.

## The Solution
The intern worked on developing a proof-of-concept (PoC) application that incorporates a data preprocessing and topic modelling solution.
